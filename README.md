Digital posters and flyers have to be visually appealing while satisfactorily communicating a message to the public. Creating posters and fliers for public relations and marketing campaigns will expose you to scaling and proper design layouts in digital platforms.


**TASK 2: LOGO**
Logos are a representation of what a brand or organization stands for. They speak volumes about what companies do and subtly express their values.
